Data Structures
A stack is like a stack of plates.
A hashmap is a glorified dictionary.

Data structures are the way to organize and store data in a systematic and efficient manner.

The best way to learn data structures is with common household items.

Array
An array is just a fixed container with multiple tiny containers inside of it.
The size cannot be changed.
The easiest way to resize an array is to create a ne array with he deisred result and copy th contents of the old array into it. We can delete the old array by setting it to null.
Can store different data types.
Each small container is laelled with indexes.
You can use a for loop to iterae through every element in an array. This is called a linear search.


Abstract data types
Queue
FIFO: First In First Out data structures. 
The first person in line gets served first.
To do list.
Two q operations: enqueue, dequeue.
Enque: Adding to the end of the queue
Dequeue: The first person in line to be served.

Stack
LIFO: Last In First Out
Gmail is a stack.
Pile of folded clothes in a shelf.
Operations for adding things in a stack: push, pop.
Push: Adding something to the top of the stack.
Pop: Removing something to the top of the stack.
